This is an ai argument creator idk how to write descriptions

you gotta either have ollama or groq
after you first execute the program "settings.json" will be created
mode 1 is ollama mode and 2 is groq mode
if you're using ollama be sure that ollama is running in the background and the desired model is installed and stated in the json
if you're using groq then put your api key and change the model if you want
don't forget to turn the "mode" to 2 if you're going groq way
enjoy i guess
